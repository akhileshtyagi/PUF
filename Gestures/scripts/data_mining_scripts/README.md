###Script Files Detail
Describes the purpose of each file. Also describes the input, output used; how to interpret the output is also described.

######challenge_response.py
Defined in this file is a class which contains information about the challenge response pairs. This class knows how to read the data sets, and put them into a usable format.

######main.py
Provides the ability to:
1) run all machine learning tests
2) run each of the machine learning tests individually

######trainer.py
Handles the training of the machine learning models. Offers methods to run different types of machine learning tests, and returns their results.
