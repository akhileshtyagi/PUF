###### data_mining_scripts
Scripts which analyze the ability of machine learning tools to predict the responce to a challenge given a number of challenge response pairs. The ultimate goal of these scripts is to be able to say "X machine learning tool needs Y challenge-response pairs before it can predict the response to a challenge with Z% accuracy."

###### variability_analysis_scripts
These scripts will analyze the variablility of the mu, sigma model. This will be similar to the way in which the variability analysis was done for the raw data.
