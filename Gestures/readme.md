# PUF Gesture Testers

---

1. Download apk to your device [puf_gesture.apk](https://github.com/iantrich/PUF/blob/master/Gestures/puf_gesture.apk) (Right click and select 'Save link as')
2. Download a file manager. I recommend [ES File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop&hl=en)
3. Turn on 'Install from Unknown Sources' Depending on your device this usually found in Settings - Security. Google your model and Android version if not found there
4. Using the file manager, find the downloaded apk file and open it to install
5. Once the **Gesture Authentication** application is opened, open the menu by hitting the three dots in the top right
6. Open `Settings` (bottom option from the menu) and enter in **Tester Name** and **Device Name**
7. Go back to the main screen and trace the paths shown in the order: __green__, __blue__, __red__
8. The `seed` attribute in the upper right will incrememnt until 8, at which point the `Total` will incrememnt and the `Seed` will go back to 1
9. Once `Total` has reached anywhere between 8 to 20, send the data by opening the menu again and hitting **Email CSVs**. From here you will open choose how to send the email and simply hit send.
