# PUF Keyboard Testers
1. Download apk to your device [pufkeyboard.apk](https://github.com/iantrich/PUF/blob/master/Keyboard/pufkeyboard.apk) (Right click and select 'Save link as')
2. Download a file manager. I recommend [ES File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop&hl=en)
3. Turn on 'Install from Unknown Sources' Depending on your device this usually found in Settings - Security. Google your model and Android version if not found there.
4. Using the file manager, find the downloaded apk file and open it to install
5. Go to Settings - Language & Input
6. Hit the check box for the keyboard 'Sample Soft Keyboard'
7. Change your default keyboard to 'Sample Soft Keyboard'
8. Once you are done collecting data, open your file manager and navigate to the folder named 'PUF' from your root directory. There you will find two CSV files. Replace 'Tester' in their file names with your name and email the results to iantrich@iastate.edu and timedee@iastate.edu
