Described in this document is a physical unclonable function (PUF) utilizing the variability derived from the pressure with which users interact with their mobile device touchscreens. We illustrate how a sequence of these pressure values from descrete touchscreen interactions may be used to uniquely characterize a user-device pair. This characterization method may find many applications in protecting access to a mobile device from a malicious party. As a result, the effectiveness of this scheme is described in terms of how one user may be differentiated from another.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Mobile devices are ubiquitus in the modern world. These devices are becoming progressively more important for many applications with security sensative data. 
Securing mobile devices poses unique challenges and opportunities compared to traditional data security where it is difficult for an attacker to access the physical device on which the data is stored or from which the sensitive data may be accessed.
%
The reality that an attacker may be able to gain access to a physical device makes securing any data stored on or accessed by a mobile device significantly more challenging. Traditional physical unclonable functions (PUFs) which can be used to uniquely to a given hardware device are no longer sufficient to guarentee the authenticity of a user.
%
This modivates an extension of the traditional PUF known as a user-device physical unclonable function(UD-PUF). This UD-PUF entangles the physical characteristics of the user in combination with the device to enable a more secure authentication scheme.

\section{Modeling a User-Device Pair}
\label{sec:modeling}
Interactions between useres and devices are complex. To interpret these actions in a meaningful way, in order to preform an authentication for example, it is necessary to simplify these interations. The chosen model must provide sufficient entropy such that a model generated with a given user-device pair is not consistantly reproducable by another user or on a different device. The modeling method must also be easily reproducable by the origional user on the origional device. A model having the neccessary characteristics required for this application is a Marcov Chain.
%
%TODO describe what is a marcov chain
Marcov Chains are useful in predicting systems who's behavior can be modeled in descrete states. The transitions between states can be identified to happen with some probability.
%Other information about marcov chains

The goal in modeling a system with a marcov model is to classify the system in terms of its transitions between states. If such a model is to be used to purposes of uniquely identifying a given system, than the states of the model must be chosen in a way which exposes the uniqueness of the system.
The states of our marcov model are defined by the range in which

%this figure describes how false positive and false negative percentages vary based on authentication threshold

\caption{Describes how false positive and false negative percentages vary as the authentication threshold is adjusted.}
\label{fig:threshold_vs_percentages}
\end{figure}

%TODO
%describe what the authentication threshold is
%define false positive
%define false negative
%explain why the intersection of these two is significant in choosing the authentication threshold
In distinguishing a particular user from another different user, it is necessary to develop a method of compairason between users. In our method of compairason we take the probability associated with a touch pressure coming after a sequence of preceding touch pressures for a particular user and compute the difference between this probability and the probability of the same touch pressure coming after the same sequence of touches for a different user. The average of these probability differences is taken to be the difference between two users.
%
Once a compairason is established a natural extension is a system of authentication. This system needs to determine when two sets of touch pressue values came from the same user-device pair. When authenticating a user, we take one minus the average difference between the model constructed from the two sets of touch pressure values. Take this value to be the authentication percentage for a given set of touch pressure values against another.
%
%TODO TODO add more metrics, and explain them, provide more graphs about them
To determine how well this system does at differentiating users it is useful to develop metrics which describe the system's performance under conditions which are similar to it's protential real-world applications. Figure \ref{fig:threshold_vs_percentages} illustrates how false positive percentage and false negative percentage vary based on where the threshold for authentication is set. 
%authentication threshold described
Here, authentication threshold refers to the value of authentication percentage one model must have against another for the models to be considered the same; two models which are the same are supposed to have been created from touches generated by the same user-device pair.
%false positive percentage described
False positive percentage measures what fraction of authentcations between two sets of touch pressures which did not come from the same user-device pair, therefore these sets should not be considered the same, but did authenticate as being the same in our authentication system.
%false negative percentage described
False negative percentage is exactly the inverse of false positive percentage in that it describes what fraction of authentications between two sets of touch pressures which did come from the same user-device pair, but did not authenticate as being the same in our authentication system.
%significance of the intersection of false positive, false negative values
In Figure \ref{fig:threshold_vs_percentages} there exists a clear intersection between false negative and false positive percentages. This intersection is significant; at this point the system nither biased toward allowing user-device pairs which should not authenticate to pass authentication nor toward disallowing user-device pairs, which should authenticate, from passing authentication. This point represents a balance allowing for %TODO
